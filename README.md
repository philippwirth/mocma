# Multi-objective Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
Python implementation of the multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation (mocma) evolution strategy as described by C. Igel, T. Suttorp and N. Hansen in "Steady-state Selection and Efficient Covariance Matrix Update in the Multi-objective CMA-ES".

# To do
Replace crowding distance by S-metric and implement fast nondominated sorting.
